# thesis-explorations

Repository for exploring the LangChain, LangSmith, and LangGraph ecosystem, focusing on AI-driven code execution and Jupyter notebook automation.

## Project Structure

Inside `src/`:

- **Command_Executor**  
  *An agent that processes natural language commands and generates corresponding JSON function calls. Includes a comprehensive test suite.*

- **Define_Functions**  
  *A script for analyzing Jupyter notebooks to detect incomplete function definitions, infer missing logic from surrounding context, and generate function bodies.*

- **Notebook-Operations**  
  *An interactive tool for manipulating Jupyter notebooks using AI, enabling operations such as reading, writing, adding, and deleting cells through natural language commands.*

- **Testing**
  *An explorative testing ground aimed at iteratively improving on tool documentation for better agent use.
